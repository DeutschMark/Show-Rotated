# Show Rotated

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It superimposes the current shown glyph as a rotated copy of it self. This can be pretty helpful when working on symmetric characters (e.g. [0, O, o, S, s, Z, z, X, x, …]). The degree of a desired match depends on each design, of course. It is not nessessary to match the drawing with it’s rotated counterpart, but it can indeed help to balance letters in matters of weight distribution and/or optical centering.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon) and copy the `ShowRotated.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
